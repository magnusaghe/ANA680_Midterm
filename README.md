# Abstract
This project uses the Naive Bayes model to classify student race/ethnicity as one of five groups - Group A, Group B, Group C, Group D, or Group E, with a 35.2% accuracy.
Despite having a low accuracy it was however the best model out of eight classification models tested (Kernel SVM - 34%, Logistic regression - 31.6%, Linear SVM - 30.4%, Random Forest - 27.2%, XGBoost - 26.4%, KNN - 24.4% and Decision Tree - 23.2%).
Developed by Magnus Aghe as part of the Machine Learning Deployment course AN680 at National University, San Diego, CA.
The model uses as predictors Math Score, Reading Score, and Writing Score. 
Dataset used is Student Performance in Exams Dataset obtained from Kaggle.com at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/code
